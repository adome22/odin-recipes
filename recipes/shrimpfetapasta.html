    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is a recipe I just kind of fooled around with and made up. When i first tasted it I was proud! I felt like I was eating a meal from a groumet Italian restaurant!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white wine</li>
        <li>1 pound linguine pasta</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1(6 ounce)package crumbled feta cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil. 
            Cook shrimp, garlic and white wine for 5 minutes, or until shrimp is pink. 
            Remove shrimp with slotted spoon and set aside.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

        <br>
        <li>
            While pasta is cooking, cook tomatoes with remaining 1 tablespoon oil, oregano and basil over medium heat in wine mixture until tender, 10 minutes.
