    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        This chicken fried rice recipe tastes just like what they serve in restaurants.
        A stir-fry with chicken, rice, soy sauce, and veggies like peas, carrots, celery, and bell peppers.
        My sister just sort of whipped this up one day, and it's very good!
